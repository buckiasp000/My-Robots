## Background
The goal of this assignment was to create a robot with a unique shape that learned to do a task. I was inspired by Boston Dynamics "Spot" and set out to make a robot that could mimic its gait. Unfortunately my results weren't on par with Boston Dynamics, but they did train the robot to crawl along the ground at a somewhat regular gait.
## Running the code
First pull the code into a repository and then navigate to the My-Robots folder in the terminal using "cd"
Type "Python3 search.py" into the command line and hit enter
Wait for all of the text to print in the terminal and then watch as an evolved ludobot scampers accross the floor

## Modifying the code
Much modification can be done in the "constants.py" file. You can modify the amount of generations and individuals as well as the gravity, power of the motors and other variables that could improve the morphology of the dog.
