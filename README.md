## Background
The goal of this assignment was to create a morphology of worm-like robots. I created a program that generates a kinematic chain (a jointed, motorized, innervated, sensorized snake) with a: random number of randomly shaped links with random sensor placement along the chain.

Links with and without sensors are colored green and blue, respectively.

## Evolution
The fitness function is a function of distance traveled along the y axis.

## Running the code
First pull the code into a repository and then navigate to the My-Robots folder in the terminal using "cd"
Type "Python3 search.py" into the command line and hit enter
Wait for all of the text to print in the terminal and then watch as an evolved ludobot wiggles accross the floor

## Modifying the code
Much modification can be done in the "constants.py" file. You can modify the amount of generations and individuals as well as the gravity, power of the motors and other variables that could improve the morphology of the worm.
